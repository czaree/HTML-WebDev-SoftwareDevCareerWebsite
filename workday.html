            <p>Typically, software developers are tasked with the creative portion of developing software, coding the programs that allow specific tasks, such as playing games, watching a movie, or writing a business letter. Every industry, both public and private, has some sort of demand for specialized software that can make their jobs easier.</p>
            <p>Developers can fill a few different types of roles depending upon the needs of their employers, but generally their day-to-day work involves</p>
            <ul class = "list-fancy">
              <li>developing and testing software to meed client's needs</li>
              <li>recommending and developing upgrades for existing applications</li>
              <li>creating models and diagrams in order to show programmers the code required for software</li>
              <li>monitoring quality and performance of applications through testing and maintenance</li>
              <li>carefully documenting all work for future reference</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class = "fw-bold py-3 text-center">Required Skills</h2>
            <p>Ideally, if you're a software you don't just want to work at an average level. In order to do expeptionally well as a software developer, you must</p>
            <ul>
              <li class = "fw-bold">be able to be creative and innovate</li>
              <p>Software developers are the primary creative forces behind applications. Don't be afraid to think outside of the box and experiment, even with things others may think impossible or worthless.</p>
              <li class = "fw-bold">communicate and work  well with others</li>
              <p>Collaboration is an essential part of the development process. Whatever your're makng is a product of teamwork. If you're able to convery your ideas clearly, the result will be of higher quality.</p>
              <li class = "fw-bold">have analytical skill</li>
              <p>You'll often have to tweak applications to meet users' and client's individual needs, so being able to rapidly figure out the best course of action is an important.</p>
              <li class = "fw-bold">be able to concentrate effectively</li>
              <p>Software development is a complex process. Even attempting to figure out the smallest problem requires an intense amount of focus due to the massive amount of detail a project can hold. More likely tha not, if you get distracted you'll have to start the problem-solving process all over again if you get distracted, so being able to ignore disruptions is a useful ability.</p>
              <li class = "fw-bold">have problem solving skills</li>
              <p>Being able to fix whatever goes wrong during the development process is probably the number one skill a software developer can possess. Like with any programming, bugs are bound to appear in every corner of your code. If you have the ability to figure out how to find and repair them, every other obstacle on the path to becoming a software developer is a tiny bump in the road.</p>

            <p>One of the more unpopular aspects of being a software developer is the irregular schedule. Employers will often assign shifts that occur at various inconvenient hours of, where the work period is also much longer than the average 9 to 5.</p>
            <p>Working a job in the tech industry often means it will consume most of your life. Overtime is common, almost expected, and urgent tasks will interrupt both weekends and planned vacations. </p>
